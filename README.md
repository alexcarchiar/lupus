# Lupus
Small program to help the narrator do his job without cards for the game "Lupus in tabula" or "Werewolves"

Made by alexcarchiar

## Intro
The game is simple: there is one narrator who needs to coordinate the game, give everyone their roles and make
sure nobody cheats. At the same time, he will be the moderator during the day and will call out the roles during
the night.

There are two phases: the day and the night. During the night, everyone "sleeps" (closes his/her eyes) and the
narrator calls out the roles and asks them to do what they are supposed to. During the day, people need to cast
their votes and decide who is a "lupus" (wolf in latin). The game ends when either the good ones or the bad ones win.

## Roles

#### Good guys
- Villager: they have no powers. They have to guess the wolves and vote them out during the day.
- Medium: he/she is called once every two turns. He/she can ask the narrator to reveal if one of the  
  dead players was good or bad.
- Foreseer: he/she is called once every two turns (usually when you don't call the Medium). He/she does
  the same thing as the Medium but only for players who are not dead yet.
- Guard: he/she can choose one person every night to protect from the wolves, including him/herself. He/she
  cannot choose the same person two nights in a row.
- Hunter: he/she has a rifle with one bullet and can use it once in the game to kill a player.
- Prostitute: he/she decides one person to sleep with the night; if this person is a wolf he/she dies, otherwise
  nothing happens.
- Mason: a group of people who know each other's role. In order to be effective there needs to be at least two of them.
- Owl: he/she decides one person each turn who starts with two votes on his head.
- Onionboy: a villager who smells like onion. It is just a joke character that has no special powers other than making
  my friends happy.
- Cupid: he/she decides two lovers that will be bound for the rest of the game: if one dies, the other one dies too.
  The two lovers can also be both good guys, one good guy and a bad guy and both bad guys.

#### Bad guys
- Wolves
